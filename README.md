## Web Logbook Mobile

This mobile application is a sort of addon to the main [Web Logbook](https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook/). The app is written in the Flutter framework and Dart programming language.


# Changelog

The changelog is [here](https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook-mobile/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


# Supported OS

Currently Android only. Even though the Flutter framework supports everything, I don't have now the possibility to build for iOS, but for sure will do something in the future.

# ToDo

- Write a proper Readme
- Build an app for iPhone
- Check a nighttime calculation
- Add some simple stats
