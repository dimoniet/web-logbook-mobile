# Changelog

The changelog is [here](https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook-mobile/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


# Supported OS

Currently Android only. Even though the Flutter framework supports everything, I don't have now the possibility to build for iOS, but for sure will do something in the future.

# ToDo

- build an app for iPhone
- check a nighttime calculation
- add some simple stats
